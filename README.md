## How to Play

Run the script in your terminal or preferred Python environment using:

```

Use the arrow keys to control the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right).
Eat the red apples to grow the snake and increase your score.
Avoid collisions with the window borders and the snake's own body.
If the game is over, press Enter to restart.

The score is displayed at the top of the game window.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following parameters in the script:

    FPS: Set the frames per second for the game.
    WIDTH and HEIGHT: Adjust the dimensions of the game window.
    Colors: Modify the color values for WHITE, BLACK, GREY, GREEN, and RED to change the appearance of the game elements.
